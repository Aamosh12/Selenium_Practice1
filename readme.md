# Selenium Automation

**Selenium_Practice** is a Python code designed to hone your automation skills using the **Selenium library**. By running this code, you can create a new Gmail account and input user details like *name*, *password*, and *date of birth*, which are then automatically filled in the required fields through **Selenium**. With specific codes, the rest of the activities are also automated.
